# Description

This is the frontend for the Humble Superhero API, built with Next.js 15, Mantine 7, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It provides a modern and interactive interface to manage superheroes by allowing users to add new entries and view a dynamically updated roster.

This is based on a minimal template for a Next.js project with Mantine and Tailwind CSS, provided by the Mantine team. 

More of these templates can be explored here: [mantine official website](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/)
